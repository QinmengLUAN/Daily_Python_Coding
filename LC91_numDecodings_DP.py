91. Decode Ways
Medium

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:

Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Notes of Wisdom:
(1): Handling s starting with '0'. Alternative: I would recommend treating as an error condition and immediately returning 0. It's easier to keep track and it's an optimization.
(2) (3): Pay close attention to your comparators. For (1) you want 0 <, not 0 <= . For (2) you want 10 <=, not 10 <
