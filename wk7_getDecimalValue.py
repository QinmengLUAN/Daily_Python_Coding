1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
Easy: Linked list
Algorithm complexity:
Time complexity: O(n).
Space complexity: O(1).

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880
